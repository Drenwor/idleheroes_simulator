# idleheroes_simulator
Open source simulator for mobile game [Idle Heroes](https://www.facebook.com/Idleheroes/)

This is an open source simulator to help each Idle Hero player. Currently under development.

## Dependencies

The program is written in **Python**.

You can either [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) it or use [this online tool](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_python_online.php)

## Currently Supported (V0.1)

The following features are currently supported in the simulator:
* Gold/Gem ratio per player. Gives best ingame ratio possible and where to get it.
* Tavern profit in absolute and relative gem values.
* Event balance versus daily quest. Profit in event versus out of it.
* Monthly resource balance.

## Assumptions

The following assumptions are used in the simulator:
* Idle Heroes uses multiple random variables. Hence, values obtain from this simulator are *mean values* that can vary per player.
* Mostly 5* shards become fodder. Currently, I assume all shards will give fooder. This will be changed in the future.
* Monthly resource balance does not consider: Arena fight rewards (daily and end of season), marauder friendship rewards, aspen dungeon rewards

## Known Bugs

## ToDo

Internal features:
* Change Priviledge/Normal cards nomenclature
* Include more tavern strategies
* Improve VIP separation
* Count shards/branches in tavern balance
* Battle simulator
* Adding Machine Learning to the algorithms

External features:
* Launch webpage
* Add dashboard/graphical interface
